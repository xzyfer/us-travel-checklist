### What is this?
This is my fun little experiment to see if Github's crowd source 
model could be leveraged, given adequate exposure, for something 
as simple as a todo list. 

### Why am I doing this?
There are many things I suck at, among them are: 
* planning
* organization
* being touristy
* and most unfortunately, writting TODO lists.

### How can I help?
Long story short, I'm travelling to San Fransisco for ~2 months 
(Aug/Sep) this year primarily, but by no means limited to, San 
Fransisco.
I've been to the US before, spending the majority of my time in
Las Vegas, NV.
Looking for some fun stuff to do. The kinds of things the locals
do that you don't read about in the travel guides.

**TL;DR** I'm an Australian web developer spending two Aug/Sep in the
US, primarily but not limited San Fransisco. Looking for fun (non-
touristy) stuff to do. I wonder if I can crowd source github for ideas.

### TODO
* Visit/tour the Google campus
* Skate around Golden Gate Park
* Catch a cable car in San Fransisco
* Drive (on the wrong side of the road)
* See Penn & Teller in Las Vegas
* See a band play (US rock bands don't often travel to Australia)
* Attend a tech conference (http://goo.gl/rqZEP) - seeing [@paul_irish](https://twitter.com/paul_irish) talk would be all kinds of awesome
