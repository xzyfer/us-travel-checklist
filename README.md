### What is this?
This is my fun little experiment to see if Github's crowd source
model could be leveraged, given adequate exposure, for something
as simple as a todo list.

### Why am I doing this?
There are many things I suck at, among them are:
* planning
* organization
* being touristy
* and most unfortunately, writting TODO lists.

### How can I help?
Long story short, I'm travelling to San Fransisco for ~2 months
(Aug/Sep) this year primarily, but by no means limited to, San
Fransisco.
I've been to the US before, spending the majority of my time in
Las Vegas, NV.
Looking for some fun stuff to do. The kinds of things the locals
do that you don't read about in the travel guides.

US, primarily but not limited San Fransisco. Looking for fun (non-
touristy) stuff to do. I wonder if I can crowd source github for ideas.
