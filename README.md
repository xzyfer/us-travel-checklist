### What is this?
This is my fun little experiment to see if Github's crowd source
model could be leveraged, given adequate exposure, for something
as simple as a todo list.

### Why am I doing this?
Most threads I read regarding overseas travel, especially to the US I find overly touristy.
I'm not one for hikes through national parks, or going to Disney Land.

I want to travel San Francisco the way people should travel Melbourne, Australia.
Talking to locals, wandering the city's laneways for days with no plans. Discovering all
the hidden awesomeness it has to offer.

I'll be spending the majority of my time there working with local collegues who I'm sure will show me a great time.
But I'd like to break away and get lost :) **My intention** is to collect, and curate a set of individual,
uniquely SF experiences that I can share back with you all, and anyone who stumbles across this is via Google :)

### How can you help?
Long story short, I'm travelling to San Francisco for ~2 months
(Aug/Sep) this year primarily, but by no means limited to, San
Francisco.
I've been to the US before, spending the majority of that time in Las Vegas, NV.
Looking for some fun stuff to do. The kinds of things the locals
do that you don't read about in the travel guides.

If a local's pizza or taco suggestion gets shortlisted, lunch is on me!
